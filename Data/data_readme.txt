Other csv files are from original datasets cited in StoltzfusA_NorrisR_2016__On the Causes of Evolutionary Transition -Transversion Bias:
organism_firstAuthor_yr.csv, data copied directly (usually from supplmental) into notepad or excel and sometimes column names and spaces are modified for easy import into R.
Note: For peris one I couldn't simply copy and paste, i had to use an online OCR converter (instead of copy and pasting manually), http://www.onlineocr.net, i did check for correctness line by line in columns 1 and last column in first file-did that check twice, and then spot checked rest (rest of columns, rest of files). Never found any mistakes by ocr.

Note: sometimes when saving an excel to a tab delimted it will change some special characters to something else, eg an arrow to a question mark, which is fine.
