# TsTv_paper
This repository contains the data and code needed to produce tables and figures for the paper [CITATION]. The one .rmd file in folder "Code" performs all analyses on data files from folder "Data" and outputs figures into folder "Analysis".  Some slight changes to formatting and fonts were made to figures and tables after output for the final publication. Table 4 was created by hand.

Code was written in R version 3.3.2 and Rstudio version 0.99.903.
